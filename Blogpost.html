        <p>Hi. My name is Lauren and I'm exicted to build my own webpage because I currently have a travel blog via Tumblr and want to make it even better!
        <p> I hope to learn the skills I need to be able to flip it into a website. I want to add dropdown menus, sidebars, have a search bar; enssentially build a user friendly travel website with tips and trick for the budgeted 20 something.
